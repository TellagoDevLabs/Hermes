==What is Hermes?==
Hermes is a simple opensource middleware for communicating applications. Hermes follows the Publish/Subscribe messaging pattern where senders (Publishers) instead of send the messages directly to receivers (Subscribers), they publish the messages to a centralized repository (Hermes in this case) characterized into topics. Subscribers express in one or more topics.

==How is Hermes different than any other Pub/Sub application?==
The power of Hermes resides in its super-simple protocol. Hermes has a REST API to manage groups, topics and push messages that publishers can use. Subscribers poll messages from an atom feed.
Hermes has also a web portal that you can use to administrate topics, groups and to see some statistics. You can even push messages from the web portal.

==Hermes is not Biztalk==
Hermes is not a message broker but a Publish/Subscribe infrastructure. Hermes doesn’t know what messages has receive what subscriber. It provides a paginated atom feed that subscribers can easily navigate. 

==How does it work?==
Hermes uses mongodb to store messages…and….


==Road map==
-Enhance the portal
-Add support for long polling
-Create a real scenario application
-Create more client examples in different technologies (javascript is the most important for us)
